Executable Spring Boot

This a simple Spring boot Project that I wanna practice Java in it . 
At first Dockerize it then practice some code and challenge e.g : Design Patterns and etc . But Now I haven't any idea what I'm Doing :D


How to run project ? 
here We Have docker , At first install docker is necessary then following these rolls :
# mvn package
# to build image => docker build -t image-name:latest .
# to run image =>  docker run -d  -p 8081:8081 image-name:latest
